# Template for a Tango Device Server
This is a template for what your Readme for a Tango Device Server should look like. Direct further documentation of classes or methods used to the "doc" folder. 

## Installation
Describe how to install necessary packages (maybe drivers) needed for your Tango DS. Maybe it is needed to install by pip or clone and install from another git. You could also refer to a manual (must not be proprietary) or upload a manual to the "man" folder yourself.

## Configuration
Maybe add some configuration details that need to be set up when registering the Server. Which device properties to declare etc.

## Authors
Maybe refer to your organization and leave some contact details of how to reach you in case there are any questions.
